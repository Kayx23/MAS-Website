                        Co-Presidents for the 2020-2021 year. I’m currently in my 5th and final year of the Actuarial &
                        Financial Math program and have been on the executive team since my 3rd year at Mac. I have also
                        spent 3 co-op terms working at Manulife and Swiss RE and would be happy to answer any questions
                        you might have about work as an actuarial co-op, balancing extra-curricular commitments or
                        studying for actuarial exams. Outside of school, I enjoy watching Hockey, UFC and going to the
                        gym.</p>

                        TD Insurance working with their life and health insurance business. This role gave me a great
                        understanding of what it’s like to work as a life actuary. I have also passed the 3 preliminary
                        SOA exams and I would be happy to share any knowledge I have on these topics. When taking a
                        break from school, I really enjoy travelling, playing and watching hockey, basketball and
                        soccer.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, my names Mei Lin Yu and I'm VP Admin and Operations at McMaster Actuarial Society
                        for this year. I'm in 4th year AFM co-op and currently on my school term. I've finished a co-op
                        at RBC as an actuarial analyst, so I'd be glad to help answer any questions about interviews and
                        how to network! I'm apart of the McMaster Barbell club and I have been powerlifting for a couple
                        years. I also love cooking and baking in my free time. Looking forward to virtually meeting
                        everyone at our events!</p>
