                        you might have about work as an actuarial co-op, balancing extra-curricular commitments or
                        studying for actuarial exams. Outside of school, I enjoy watching Hockey, UFC and going to the

                        break from school, I really enjoy travelling, playing and watching hockey, basketball and
