# Library Version

### jQuery
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js

Why using the Google's hosted jQuery from w3schools: 
> Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
